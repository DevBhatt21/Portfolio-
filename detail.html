        <h2>Project One - Angry Bird Project Using Java</h2>
        <p>
            Summary:  
            I developed an Angry Birds-inspired game in Java featuring physics-based projectile motion, collision detection, and interactive gameplay. The game includes a slingshot mechanism, destructible structures, a scoring system, and immersive sound effects.  

            Key technologies used include Java Swing/JavaFX, a custom physics engine, event handling, and animation.  

            Challenges such as projectile physics, collision handling, and game loop optimization were addressed efficiently.  

            Future improvements include level progression, enhanced graphics, and additional interactive elements.  

            This project highlights my problem-solving skills, game development expertise, and Java programming proficiency.

        <h2>Project Two - UK Election Analysis Using Python</h2>
        <p>
            I developed a Python-based election analysis tool for the recent UK elections, providing 13 user-selectable options to explore results for candidates, constituencies, and specific queries.  

            The project integrates data processing, visualization, and interactive user input to present election insights effectively.  

            Key features include filtering by candidate or constituency, statistical summaries, and graphical representations of results.  

            The program demonstrates my skills in data analysis, Python scripting, and user-focused application design.

        <h2>Project Three - Webpage for a Client</h2>
        <p>
            I designed and developed a custom business webpage for a client using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, tailored to their specific requirements.  

            The project included a responsive layout, interactive elements, and an optimized user experience.  

            Key features incorporated were a modern design, smooth navigation, and dynamic content updates.  

            The development process involved close collaboration with the client to ensure their vision was met.  

            This project highlights my ability to create professional, user-friendly web solutions while aligning with business needs.
